# üì∑ PyTorch 360¬∞ Video Creation for ComfyUI

Custom [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) nodes for creating 360 degree video.


## üìö Nodes

The custom nodes added by this project are available under the 'pytorch360convert' heading in the node selection tab.

### Create 360 Sweep Video Frames

This node will generate video frames by sweeping through one or more equirectangular images. Frames will be saved to the specified directory.

### Create 360 Sweep Video Frames Tensor

This node will generate video frames by sweeping through one or more equirectangular images. Frames will be returned as a stack of tensors.
